This data element is included nevertheless because many legacy systems have captured this attribute.\n\nImmunological testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis and causative substance , but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for a sensitivity.&quot;,

        &quot;comments&quot;: &quot;Immune-mediated responses have been traditionally regarded as an indicator for escalation of significant future risk. Contemporary knowledge suggests that some reactions previously thought to be immune and non-immune and still carry life threatening risk. \n\nIt is acknowledged that many clinicians may not be in a position to distinguish the mechanism of a particular reaction.  This data element is included nevertheless because many legacy systems have captured this attribute.\n\nImmunological testing may provide supporting evidence for the basis and causative substance , but no tests are 100% sensitive or specific for a sensitivity.&quot;,
